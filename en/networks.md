## 3. Network models

With the neuron and synapse models we have realized with BrainPy, users can now build networks of there own. In this section, we will introduce two main types of network models as examples: 

1) spiking neural networks that model and compute each neuron or synapse separately; 

2) firing rate networks that simplify neuron groups in the network as firing rate units and compute each neuron group as one unit.

In this chapter, we will introduce networks belongs to these two types of network models: E-I balanced network, decision making networks and continuous attractor neural network.
